# calvin-and-hobbes
A python script that downloads all of the Calvin and Hobbes comics from 1985 to 1995 from gocomics.com

Just run the script and the downloads should begin. If you are interrupted, don't worry, you can always start again later. It won't try to download files that you already have in your computer. 

If you notice that some files are missing, just run the program again and it should download the files that you don't have already.

The script will download the images into the folder it is in. It organizes the files in 11 folders, one for each year. The files are downloaded in the following format: yyyy-mm-dd.png
